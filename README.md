# Image-Recognition-using-CIFAR-10-Dataset
The goal of the project is to understand and implement Image Recognition and Classification of the CIFAR-10 dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The current industry baseline accuracy is 82%. The aim is to try and match the accuracy and understand the nuances of building a Convolutional Neural Network. The result is to identify the optimal parameters to achieve justifiable accuracy.
